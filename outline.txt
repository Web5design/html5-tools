* The story
** When I was 8 I thought I was living in the future of books.
Photos, IF maps, etc.

Don't spend a lot of time on failure.
* Discoverable narratives 
** Not asking people to choose your own anything
*** Authorial intent is important
*** What do we care about in writing?
**** A point of view
**** A right answer (or many wrong answers)
**** We want to be immersed in a text
**** We want to be lost in a fictional world
**** We want to love, or hate, the people we meet on the way
*** Not "hypertext." "Hypotext." ("Hypno"?) We want to be submerged.

From Metafilter: What happened to hypertext fiction?

If you think that the flowering of the movement occurred too soon for
the technology to carry it off successfully, turn to page 34.

If you think readers prefer to put themselves in the hands of an
author who drives the narrative rather than selecting it themselves,
turn to page 42.

*** How to build/release tension in nonlinear storytelling?
"I think the fundamental problem is that a story requires the
manipulation of tension."

*** Interactive narrative can't be video art.
It must be fun.
