"Will you read me a story?"                                      

"Read you a story? What fun would that be? I've                  
got a better idea: let's tell a story together."

- PHOTOPIA (2000), Adam Cadre

Transforming digital text into interactive narrative was one of the
first impulses in computing. Limitations in graphics meant that the
very first computer games, distributed via the early internet, were
text-based (cf. Colossal Cave, 1975). Textual gaming had an initial
commercial flowering, in part due to the heterogenity of computing
platforms at the time -- there were dozens of consumer operating
systems, each with a different set of severe constraints on memory,
processor, and display.

Text-based gaming offers a wealth of experimentation, but typing
commands at a computer can be frustrating and is seen as an obsolete
form of interaction.  Following the author/implementor model, in 2010 I
commissioned an interactive piece from game designer Emily Short with
two constraints: it must be primarily textual, but use a simple
touch-based interface.

_First Draft of the Revolution_ is an epistolary story set in a
parallel history in which written documents are magically linked. The
reader is presented with each letter in sequence, each sentence fading
in slowly to reflect the "magical" transition between sender and
receiver. The letters are at first incomplete or impetuous and cannot
be sent as-is. User interface clues (such as red text) hint which passages need
to be revised; tapping on those passages allows the reader to edit
or delete them altogether. While the message of each letter is
authorially fixed, readers control the tone and how much is revealed
or hidden in each response. (At the time of this writing, _First
Draft of the Revolution_ is still being finalized, but we intend to
publish it as a free EPUB book: to put it distinctly among other
books, not games.)
